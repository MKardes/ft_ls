Hard links point directly to the physical file on disk. Multiple hard links to the same file share the same inode (file metadata).
if you change one that one will seen in the other one.
hard link creation:
ln source_file destination file

Symbolic links (or soft links) are pointers to another file or directory by name. They can span across filesystems.
soft link creation:
ln -s target_file symbolic_link_name

The symbolic link points to the name of the target file. So if the name changes, the link is broken.Hard links do not break because 
they reach the physical file on the disk.
